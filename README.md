Sometimes its fun to leave it up to fate:
What shall your workout be today?
[Crossfit, Long Run, Gymnastics, Weightlifting] then rest
Rinse and repeat :)

Did you workout today?
    If no: here's a workout
    Have you finished the workout?
        If yes: Good job

HTML/CSS/JS Project

meh ok, this isn't my best project, not very DRY code, def could use some js that manipulates CSS, but we're not there yet in scrimba and I don't want to get ahead of myself. Just wanted a little extra project practice. I think next time I need to finish the whole scrimba and then base the project on the list of learning objectives
